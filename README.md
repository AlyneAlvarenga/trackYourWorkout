# Track Your Workouts

This React and Firebase app was created for keeping track of multiple workout plans, as well as being able to know how many times each plan was completed. 

## Currently working on

* Setting up user authentication, so that every user has their own environment - _COMPLETED_;
* Setting up a calendar view of the logged workout plans (in See Logged Workout Plans);
* Creating an Edit Card functionality, so the user can make changes to their exercises/weights without having to create a new card.
